# hangman-game
- a classic hangman game built with python
- this project uses Python concepts such as loops, functions, sets, conditionals, and basic game logic to build a classic Hangman game

  # How It Works
  - a random word is selected from a word list
  - you guess one letter at a time
  - correct guesses reveal letters in the word
  - wrong guesses slowly draw the hangman 
  - guess the word before the drawing is complete to win!
